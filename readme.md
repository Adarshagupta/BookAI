AI Book Generator
=================

This Python script uses the OpenAI API to generate a 100,000-word book on a topic of your choice.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Python 3.6 or higher
    
*   OpenAI API key
    

Installation
------------

1.  Clone this repository or download the script file.

```git clone https://github.com/Adarshagupta/BookAI/```
`cd BookAI`
```
function test() {
  console.log("This code will have a copy button to the right of it");
}
```
    
2.  Copy

`pip install openai`
    
3.  Open the script in a text editor and replace "your\_api\_key\_here" with your actual OpenAI API key.

4.  Run the projecct
    

Usage
-----

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
    
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the script.
    
3.  Copypython book\_generator.py
    
4.  When prompted, enter the topic for your book.
    
5.  The script will start generating content, displaying progress as it goes.
    
6.  Once complete, the generated book will be saved in a file named generated\_book.txt in the same directory.
    

Important Notes
---------------

*   This script makes multiple API calls to OpenAI, which will incur costs. Be aware of the pricing and set appropriate usage limits in your OpenAI account.
    
*   The quality and coherence of the generated book may vary. AI-generated content might not maintain consistent narrative or factual accuracy over 100,000 words.
    
*   The script includes error handling for rate limit errors and will pause for 60 seconds if the rate limit is exceeded.
    
*   There's a small delay (1 second) between API calls to help avoid hitting rate limits.
    
*   The generated content is saved progressively. If the script is interrupted, you'll still have the content generated up to that point.
    

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter issues:

1.  Ensure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.
    
2.  Check for any error messages in the console output.
    
3.  Verify that the script has write permissions in the directory.
    
4.  If the output file is empty, check the console for error messages or unexpected behavior.
    

Ethical Considerations
----------------------

*   Be mindful of the content you're generating and its potential uses.
    
*   Consider the ethical implications and potential copyright issues of using AI-generated content.
    

Customization
-------------

You can modify the max\_tokens parameter in the generate\_chunk function to adjust the length of each generated chunk. However, be aware that larger values may impact coherence and increase API usage.
